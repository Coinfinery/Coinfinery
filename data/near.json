    "summary": "NEAR is a decentralized application platform designed to simplify the development and use of blockchain-based applications. It aims to secure high-value assets like money and identity while providing a user-friendly experience, scalability across millions of devices, and sustainable business models for developers. NEAR focuses on intuitive onboarding, predictable pricing, and subscription-based models for users, while supporting familiar programming languages and robust development tools for developers. NEAR’s scalability is achieved through sharding, allowing the network to increase capacity as demand grows. Its staking mechanism, Thresholded Proof of Stake, promotes decentralization by encouraging broad participation from validators without centralization risks. NEAR balances network costs, incentivizes validators, and ensures long-term sustainability through its inflation mechanism and Protocol Treasury. Key stakeholders include validators, developers, token holders, the NEAR Foundation, and third-party observers, creating a community-driven governance model focused on usability, scalability, simplicity, and decentralization.",
    
    "token_utility": "The NEAR token (NEAR) serves as the native asset of the platform, facilitating transactions, staking, and governance. Validators stake NEAR tokens to secure the network and receive rewards through Proof of Stake. Token holders can participate in governance decisions, with the system designed to balance decentralization and network efficiency. Developers are incentivized through contract rewards from transaction fees, providing a direct business model without needing to create separate tokens. The Protocol Treasury, funded by 0.5% of annual inflation, supports ecosystem development. Hidden validators and fishermen enhance network security by validating transactions and detecting malicious behavior.",
  
    "risk_factors": "NEAR faces challenges in maintaining decentralization and security while balancing incentives for network participants. Inflation and transaction fees must be carefully managed to sustain validator participation and network efficiency. Potential risks include: Validator Behavior – Misconduct such as double signing and invalid chunks are mitigated through progressive slashing. Hidden Validators and Fishermen – Security relies on hidden validators and fishermen, whose integrity is essential for system fairness. Governance Complexity – Balancing efficiency with decentralization requires careful oversight to avoid capture by large stakeholders. Cross-Shard Communication – Sharded networks introduce complexity in transaction validation and state consistency. Market and Regulatory Risks – Regulatory uncertainty and market volatility could impact the project’s growth and adoption.",
