    "summary": "The whitepaper introduces the Sui Smart Contracts Platform, a decentralized system for managing programmable assets using the Move programming language. It explains Suiâ€™s object-centric architecture, where assets are represented as objects with strict ownership and access rules. The platform is maintained by a permissionless set of authorities and leverages Byzantine consistent broadcast and DAG-based consensus to achieve safety, liveness, and high performance. Sui supports light clients for authenticated reads and full clients for auditing and maintaining state. It also includes mechanisms for committee reconfiguration, client-driven authority updates, and bridges to other blockchains. Emphasis is placed on low-latency execution, scalability through parallelism, and the composability and safety of smart contracts written in Move.",
    "tokenomics": "SUI is the native token of the platform, used to pay for gas fees across all operations. Token holders can delegate their SUI to authorities, who operate the network during fixed-duration epochs. Authorities and their delegators receive a share of gas fees based on their stake and operational contributions. This delegated proof-of-stake model incentivizes participation and helps determine authority voting power. While foundational economic mechanisms are outlined, the full tokenomics are expected to be detailed in a separate dedicated paper.",
    "risk_factors": "1. Byzantine Failures: The system depends on a quorum of honest authorities; if this assumption fails, safety and liveness could be compromised. 2. Latency: Transactions involving shared objects require global consensus, which introduces higher latency compared to those using only owned or read-only objects. 3. Authorization Issues: Transactions must be properly authorized to access or mutate specific objects. Misconfigured access or ownership can cause rejection or system inconsistencies. 4. Scalability Challenges: Although the architecture supports parallel execution, shared object transactions can become bottlenecks due to required sequencing in consensus.\n5. Client Dependence: Clients are responsible for updating lagging authorities. If a client is compromised or behaves incorrectly, it may introduce vulnerabilities or inconsistencies in the system.",
