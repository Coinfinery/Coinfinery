    "summary": "Axelar provides a decentralized network and protocol suite designed to enable seamless communication and asset transfers across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Its core protocols, the Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, allow platform builders and developers to create interoperable applications across different chains. Axelar facilitates cross-chain address discovery and routing, similar to how the Internet relies on BGP for discovering network addresses and routing paths. The network functions as a uniform layer, providing a seamless solution for both platform developers—who require no integration work—and application builders, who can use a single protocol and API to access global liquidity and communicate with the entire ecosystem. Axelar’s governance model is shared, allowing developers to propose new integration points, routing mechanisms, and application-level protocols. Users can vote on these proposals, and validators will implement changes if approved. The network also maintains a pool of funds to reimburse users in case of unexpected emergencies, controlled via the governance protocol, ensuring adaptability and resilience.",
    "token_utility": "Axelar's tokenomics rely on a decentralized network of validators running a Byzantine consensus protocol. Validators play a crucial role in verifying and signing transactions, ensuring secure and smooth cross-chain transfers. The project enables blockchain builders to integrate their ecosystems with others, while developers can use the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to create interoperable applications. Users can interact directly with applications across different chains from their wallets. Axelar’s tokenomics involve the creation and control of pegged-S tokens by DAxelar upon initialization, facilitated by a structured workflow using threshold cryptography. Validators use threshold cryptography to collectively generate deposit addresses and sign transactions, ensuring that tokens cannot be spent unless a threshold number of validators coordinate to approve the transfer. This process supports arbitrary source chains, including non-smart contract chains like Bitcoin. The governance model allows developers to propose new integration points, routing mechanisms, and application-level protocols. Users can vote on these proposals, and validators will implement changes if approved. Governance also includes managing a pool of funds to cover unexpected losses, reinforcing network security and adaptability.",
    "risk_factors": "Axelar faces significant challenges in achieving decentralized trust, high safety, and liveness for cross-chain communication. The project must maintain decentralization and openness while protecting assets and states across chains. Axelar’s threshold signature scheme is designed to tolerate a dishonest majority, meaning that the network can remain secure even if more than half of the validators act maliciously. Validators use pre-signatures to complete most of the signing work offline, reducing the computational and communication burden during transaction execution. This improves transaction speed and ensures high liveness for cross-chain applications. Axelar’s protocol is also robust—transactions can still succeed as long as a threshold number of validators participate honestly, even if some validators act maliciously or drop messages. The network includes fault attribution, allowing Axelar to identify and penalize malicious validators through governance-controlled slashing rules, which helps maintain validator accountability. Additionally, Axelar’s signature scheme is secure in concurrent settings, allowing multiple key generation and signing operations to run in parallel without introducing vulnerabilities. Ensuring consensus among validators to maintain transaction integrity and prevent vulnerabilities in the cross-chain transfer process remains a critical challenge. Maintaining the network's reliability and efficiency in handling various cross-chain requests is essential for long-term success.",
