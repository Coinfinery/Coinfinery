    "token_utility": "Tether Tokens (e.g., USD₮, CNH₮, MXN₮) are issued on multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin (Omni), Ethereum (ERC-20), and Tron (TRC-20). Tokens are backed by reserves, including cash, cash equivalents, and short-term securities. KYC-verified customers can purchase and redeem tokens directly through the Tether website at a 1:1 rate. Secondary market trading is supported on major exchanges. The platform operates through a three-layer technology stack consisting of the Bitcoin blockchain, Omni Layer Protocol, and Tether Limited. The platform’s tokenomics ensure equal treatment of tokens across supported networks, with a focus on liquidity and price stability.",
  
    "risk_factors": "Tether faces risks including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and security threats. Regulatory changes could affect Tether's ability to issue or redeem tokens. Reserve value and liquidity risks stem from fluctuations in cash and securities backing tokens. Cybersecurity threats include smart contract vulnerabilities and exchange hacks. The platform’s relationship with Bitfinex raises conflict of interest concerns. Legal challenges may arise from jurisdictional differences and changes in government policy. Tether’s Proof of Reserves model addresses transparency concerns, but insolvency of banking partners or mismanagement of reserves remain potential risks.",
