# Coinfinery Crypto Summaries Dataset

A collection of 19 standardized JSON summaries covering major cryptocurrency projects, generated and curated as part of the **Coinfinery** platform. This dataset is designed to be AI-friendly, human-readable, and structured for use in research, model fine-tuning, or educational purposes.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

Each JSON file includes key information about a specific crypto project, such as:

- **Summary** – A concise explanation of the project and its core value proposition  
- **Tokenomics** – Information on token supply, distribution, utility, and incentive structure  
- **Risk Factors** – Project-specific concerns, vulnerabilities, or other risks to keep in mind  

Files are located in the `/data` folder, named by project (e.g., `bitcoin.json`, `ethereum.json`).

## 💡 Use Cases

- Fine-tune LLMs for crypto research or summarization tasks  
- Power structured search or retrieval systems  
- Build statistical models
- Prototype educational or narrative agents for blockchain tech

## 🧠 Example Structure

Here’s a simplified sample of what a file might look like:

```json
